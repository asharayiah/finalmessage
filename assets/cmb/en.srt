This animation shows ESA’s Planck spacecraft mapping the entire sky at microwave wavelengths.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
By scanning from the second Lagrange point, Planck measured tiny temperature ripples in the cosmic microwave background.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
These ripples, only tens to hundreds of microkelvin, trace density variations in the early Universe.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
After component separation, foregrounds like dust and synchrotron are removed to reveal the CMB signal.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
One widely used reconstruction is SMICA, a method that combines Planck’s frequency maps into a clean CMB map.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Galactic plane is masked in some visualisations to highlight high-latitude CMB anisotropies.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The resulting all-sky map encodes the initial conditions that grew into today’s galaxies and clusters.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
From this map, scientists derive angular power spectra that constrain the contents and geometry of the Universe.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Planck’s 2018 data release remains a key reference for temperature and polarization measurements of the CMB.
