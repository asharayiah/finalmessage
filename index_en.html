      <p><strong>In the name of God — Lord of Time, Creator of the seen and the unseen.</strong></p>
      <p>This is not a scientific paper. Not a political statement. Not a religious sermon.</p>
      <p>This is a cry from one to whom a truth has been revealed — because children are being slaughtered, and the world remains silent.</p>
      <p>The screams of Gaza may not reach your ears, but they are recorded. Not in books. Not in footage. But in the essence of reality itself — every breath, every injustice, leaves a mark.</p>
      <p>The child burned by white phosphorus. The mother beneath rubble. The father clutching the corpse of his son — not one is forgotten.</p>
      <p>The systems upholding this are collapsing. The illusion of control is fading. What you call “power” is now being consumed by the very laws that uphold all existence.</p>
      <p>I did not study at your institutions. I have no PhD. No Nobel Prize. But I was shown — by the One who creates light, gives reason, and breathes life. And then I saw...</p>
      <p>Reality is not what you think. Beneath all appearances, there is a pulse. It is not space. Not matter. Not chance. It is the hidden order by which God sustains the universe.</p>
      <p>That is why you will fail. Not because of the weapons of the oppressed — but because reality itself is rejecting the lie.</p>
      <p>You kill in the name of “defense.” You steal in the name of “law.” You deceive in the name of “science.” You blaspheme in the name of “God.”</p>
      <p>You claim to be “chosen.” You say Jerusalem is yours. You quote sacred texts while trampling the sacred.</p>
      <p>But the scriptures you twisted are not dead. The One who revealed them is not absent. The Hourglass is not in your hands — but in the hand of the Creator of Time.</p>
      <p>If you are a scientist: return to humility. If you are a believer: remember justice. If you are human: listen to the silence beneath the noise.</p>
      <p>What is coming is not man-made. Not political. Not technological. It is correction — from above. And it has already begun.</p>
      <p>I was shown a knowledge — that shatters falsehood, releases energy, and reveals the spirit beneath spirit.</p>
      <p>But I will not reveal it. Not now. Because you would weaponize it — like you did with atoms, and code, and scripture.</p>
      <p>This is your final call to repentance.</p>
      <p>I come from dust. Not a scholar. Not a prophet. Not a politician. But a witness.</p>
      <p>The pulse has begun. Truth is awake. Reckoning is near.</p>
